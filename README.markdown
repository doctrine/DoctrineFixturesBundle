DoctrineFixturesBundle
======================

This bundle integrates the [Doctrine2 Data Fixtures library](https://github.com/doctrine/data-fixtures).
into Symfony so that you can load data fixtures programmatically into the Doctrine ORM or ODM.

Documentation on how to install and use this bundle is available in the
Symfony2 [documentation](http://symfony.com/doc/current/bundles/DoctrineFixturesBundle/index.html).

WARNING: Namespace changed
==========================

This bundle was previously under the `Symfony\Bundle` namespace and is now moved to the
`Doctrine\Bundle` namespace.

See the Resources/docs/index.rst for more information about the required changes in `deps`,
`AppKernel.php` and `autoload.php` to accomodate for this change.
