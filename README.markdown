DoctrineFixturesBundle
======================

This bundle integrates the [Doctrine2 Data Fixtures library](https://github.com/doctrine/data-fixtures).
into Symfony so that you can load data fixtures programmatically into the Doctrine ORM or ODM.

An extensive cookbook entry on how to install and use this bundle is available
in the official Symfony2 documentation: [How to create Fixtures in Symfony2](http://symfony.com/doc/current/cookbook/doctrine/doctrine_fixtures.html).
